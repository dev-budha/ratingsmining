0,['Weasy'],"['Before I begin my review, I want to state that I did not buy my Power Pressure Cooker XL on Amazon, but I do thank them for allowing people to review the same items purchased elsewhere. I come to Amazon any time I want to research a product and usually end up buying here, just not this time.', ""That being said, I noticed a lot of negative feedback about the customer service at the Power Pressure Cooker company. That worried me, as I had just placed my order. I read one woman's review that she went and bought hers at Bed, Bath and Beyond for the same price, so I cancelled my order and just went and picked one up at my local BBB last night. I already roasted a chicken in it and I love it!"", 'The directions are there, just very small in the users manual. They ask you to, essentially, ""season"" the pot and the rubber gasket by filling it with water 2/3 full and setting it to the canning setting. I did that and I\'ll admit I was a little worried about how long it took to reach the pressurized point. (The instructions said it could take up to 17 minutes,  but it was more like 25) for this first time out. It finally completed the canning cycle and I left it alone until this morning.', ""Eager to try it, I got up about 30 minutes earlier than normal; I decided to roast a chicken. I used a 4 lb whole chicken but followed the instructions in the cookbook for the 3 - 2lb chickens. I put the oil in the pot, hit the Chicken/Meat button, seasoned the chicken and by the time I put the chicken in to brown it, it was sizzling. It took about 5 minutes to brown the bird. Then cancelled the Chicken/Meat program and, even though it didn't say to do so, I added about a 1/2 cup of water because I wanted a little extra stock to make soup later. Put the lid on, pushed the Soup/Stew button and adjusted the time to 30 minutes. I waited a few minutes to see how long it took to pressurize and with the food in there, it was just a matter of a couple of minutes. I left to get ready for work and when I came back 40 minutes later, it was on the Keep Warm setting. I made sure all air was released and opened the lid. The smell that hit me was amazing. And, just like on the commercial, the chicken literally fell off the bone. So tender and juicy and full of flavor! I can hardly wait for lunch. Tonight I'm testing out the canning feature and am going to can some chicken soup (that I'm making from the chicken and stock I made this a.m.) so my hubby can have homemade chicken stew for work. Tomorrow... chuck roast. I think this will just take a little trial and error. There are very few recipes in the booklet, but there are lots online. If you can, I suggest buying from a local store or Amazon; when I called to cancel the order with Power Pressure Cooker I could really see what all the complaints were about. They were very pushy and what should have been an easy 1 - 2 minute phone call took about 7 minutes. I really recommend this cooker as I can see how much simpler it's going to make things. I mean heck, I roasted a chicken before work with virtually no clean up other than the pot!"", ""UPDATE -  after using for a while: STILL AWESOME. So far have made the Mac and Cheese (to die for!) a pork roast with honey Dijon sauce, whole chicken, steak... yes, a steak, and a beef pot roast. All came out better than I could have hoped for. I will admit it was strange to cook a rib eye in liquid in a pressure cooker, and I probably won't do it again with an expensive cut, but the flavor of my spices was deep into the middle... very good. I have nothing but good to say about this unit.""]","['on November 4, 2014']","['\n      3,723 people found this helpful.\n    ']",['5.0 out of 5 stars'],['Excellent product - if you buy at the right place.']
1,['CSB'],"[""good news/ bad news...I bought this about six weeks ago . I 'm going to compare it to the Instant Pot , because I've had both. The good news is that this PC is simpler- which I loved. It was easy for me, a person who always has trouble figuring out a manual- to start cooking immediately because of the simplicity of the  buttons. The food tasted fantastic."", "" Whenever asked, they claim that this is a stainless steel pot. Well- the outside of it is. But the inside, which comes in contact with your food- is not. The inner pot is a very lightweight teflon coated pot. I don't want teflon. Would rather have stainless steel. The upper lid appears to be aluminum. Both teflon and aluminum have negative effects on our bodies."", ""In addition, the floating vent ( not the release vent, but the vent inside the handle) fell out after one month's use and no matter how hard my husband and I tried, we could not get it to stay in. So instead of being a pressure cooker, all of the steam was released out of the hole in the handle. The liquid inside thus evaporated. Food burned and the meat  got tough. I threw it out a few days ago, got an Instant Pot, which is clearly more solidly made. The inner pot and the inner lid are both made of stainless steel in the Instant Pot. I will say, however, that I do find the Instant Pot more complicated to work. So there you have it, my views of the two pots. I will say this, though. I will never, ever be without an electric pressure cooker from now on because the food tastes so great!""]","['on May 29, 2017']",['\n      371 people found this helpful.\n    '],['2.0 out of 5 stars'],['good news/ bad news.....']
2,['Joey'],"[""So I'm just a guy who has never used a pressure cooker before and bought this for the wife thinking she might be interested in it. I'm not a good cook by any means, but one quality I do have is the ability to read, which is what I did with the manual for this before I used it. I also read a LOT of reviews before I buy anything, and I'm noticing that people either loved this thing, or hated it. And for the most part (aside for missing pieces and that does suck) all of these negative reviews seem to have not used the instructions at all. For example, you'll see a lot of people complain about food sticking to the pot, but that's probably because they didn't season the pot which is literally  STEP NUMBER 1 in the manual to do before you cook anything in it. Also, there are steps in the manual to fix literally almost everything people have complained about here. And it's all simple little 10 second fixes too. This thing works perfectly fine. I mean I, a horrible cook, just made my first pot roast in about 40 minutes total (15 minutes of prep) and it came out amazing (according to my children). I had no business  cooking mind you but I was trying to give the wife a break. If you look at other pressure cookers you can kind of put the pieces together yourself. Almost all other pressure cooker ratings  are through the roof except for this one, which happens to be the only one with an infomercial. Which means people who don't normally use a pressure cooker would likely buy this. And said people are not familiar with the product. I'm just guessing here, but that just common sense. So far we are more than happy with this product, and my wife is all about me cooking with it too. Please give this a shot, but PLEASE read the instructions.""]","['on April 19, 2015']","['\n      1,525 people found this helpful.\n    ']",['5.0 out of 5 stars'],['READ THE INSTRUCTIONS...']

The manufacturer was ZERO help when this happened to me, and I was just sick at my cooker going kaput over such a little thing, after just 2-3 months of use. Here\'s what I did find though: The valve is just two parts and is SUPER EASY to put back in. I found a video on Youtube (search for ""replacing pressure valve on prowler pressure cooker"") and fixed mine in less than 60 seconds. The reason they fall out for so many people is that the little rubber o-ring is fairly easy to dislodge while you\'re washing the inside of the lid. I pay closer attention to that now. That the manufacturer didn\'t offer instructions on this, when it\'s so frikken easy, makes me even angrier about their crummy response to my emails.']","['on November 15, 2017']",['\n      3 people found this helpful.\n    '],['5.0 out of 5 stars'],['Great so far']

I was skeptical when my wife wanted it after she saw the infomercial, but after using it a few times now I am really amazed at how it cooks meals so fast and with very little cleanup. Although they say that a roast cooks in about 23 minutes, we like our roast tender, so we have arrived at it actually takes about 1 hour and 15 minutes to get a really tender roast beef. We don't use their recipes, we use our own. Our recipe for a meatloaf takes 40 minutes of cook time, but hey in an oven it would take at least twice that and still not come out as tender and juicy as it does with the PPC XL. We made chili twice, the first time we went 30 minutes, but the kidney beans didn't quite get tender, so the next time we went 40 minutes and you wouldn't believe the flavor of the chili, even the ground chuck had a flavor you just wouldn't believe. I always loved chili, but with the PPC XL it comes out tasting better than I could ever imagine. Our recipe came from 4-5 generations, but it's better now (Sorry great, great Grandma).  And you can actually brown the hamburger right in the PPC XL pot and seer a beef right in the pot. Yep a lot less cleanup and your favorite recipes coming out better than you can even imagine... Oh and it's nothing like the old fashioned pressure cookers we all grew up with, this is 100% safer then the old ones were. The lid locks and you can't get it open until you release the steam pressure and nothing bobbing around on the top like the old ones had.

While it was heating up, I used that time to cut up the greens and add to the cooker to allow for them to shrink, so that more could be added.  Once all the greens were added and stirred, I restarted the cook time for 15 mins, closed it up and let it go.  Perfect greens in perfect pot liquor.  Similar for the cabbage, except that I added all the cabbage at once to the heated water, vinegar & seasoning. Then I restarted the timer to 10 mins. It was delicious.

I've also found that it's difficult to wash. The coating on the pan insert comes off easily and there is a smell that lingers to the metal. I've only used it for pressure cooking, so I can't speak as to the other functions. But the push button controls can be confusing and a bit against intuition.

I was impressed with the weight of it and the size and the many functions this has for me to cook and can. It comes with the Pressure Cooker, Non-Stick Inner Pot, Wire Rack, Steamer Tray, Ladle, Measuring Cup, Condensation Collector, Power Chopper, Instruction Booklet, Canning Book and Recipe Book so you get quite a few accessories.', ""I looked and read through all the directions and looked through the recipe book. I decided to try the Chicken Wings and the Apple Crisp in the book. I was a bit skeptical that I could cook 4 pounds of frozen chicken wings in 10 minutes. Never having used one of these before, I'm almost embarrassed to say I was scared of the pressure part. I did the wings according to directions and they came out good. I did put them in the over to crisp them up and add more sauce after which the recipe suggests. The apple crisp came out good too."", ""So onto the cooker. The cord is a nice thick round cord with a 3 prong plug. The lid has a nice seal around it which is removable for washing. The lid locks in place tightly and you also have your steam know which turns to the open and closed position. Please make sure when releasing the steam to use a set of tongs or something because the steam is very hot coming out. Cooker has rubber grips on the bottom so the pressure cooker sets firmly on your counter and doesn't slide around."", 'I like the feature on this where when your food is done cooking, the cooker will automatically switch to the warming button to keep your food warm without it cooking further. There is also an LED display which included the timer and that counts down so you know how much time is left on your contents. I cannot wait to try more things in this including canning.', ""I love that this came with a Power Chopper. The blades on this are nice and sharp and works great for chopping veggies and walnuts (that's what I've tried so far). The blade rotates as you are chopping and there is also a cap for the end of it for storing. Definitely pleased with the Power Pressure Cooker XL and would recommend.

However I just found that if you cook beans, once they are done & the cooker goes to the warm cycle; they will continue to cook to the point they burn badly at the bottom of the pot for as long as the cooker is on. It appears that the inner pot metal can't Handel this cycle. The beans burnt so badly, I can't get the out of the metal container to a point of clean. They are infused into the metal pot. As a result of this, now the pot is growing mold when sitting empty. Apparently, the metal pot is of such poor quality; like ( tin ) that it can't handle the heat of the warmer cycle. Or, the heating cycle is programmed to high. Either way this has made it necessary to order a replacement container for an additional $29.99 at my most. The company service line I spoke with would not replace my container for free as I believe they should have. None the less, I enjoy the cooker so I will just in the future, not let it go on to is warming cycle when the cooking time has completed.

It actually took one hour and 40 minutes to cook a 3 lb. roast.  Another disappointment is that I planned on canning in this pressure cooker.  However, when I read the instruction manual, it says that it cannot be used as a pressure canner for altitudes above 2,000 feet.

Anyway, once I got it, I read and re-read the rather skimpy users manual, then I set about priming it before using for the first time.  Followed the directions, and at the end, released the steam, which came out in a huge blast, probably due to the higher pressure and temperature on the canning cycle.  A word of caution...do NOT get close to the steam release valve, and do believe the directions which say to use tongs or something similar to turn the valve to release position!', 'Today I decided I would cook a boiled dinner...ham, cabbage, carrots, onion and potatoes.  I loaded it all into the insert up to the ""max"" line, put water in, and put the top on, using the ""delay"" function since it was still rather early in the day.  Users manual doesn\'t specifically tell what to do in that case.  Simple...just choose what meal you\'re cooking and then immediately press the delay button and press it until desired time delay is reached.', 'After counting down to ""lift off"", the unit started to build pressure, but things started looking bad when steam started to escape from the sides.  Grabbing the manual, I read that should this happen, you should press down on the lid, which I did.  Nothing happened, so the next course of action was to make sure the valve thingy was moving freely on the stem.  Which it wasn\'t, so I fixed it, and the escaping steam stopped, the unit started building pressure again, and after a few minutes the cooking started.', 'In 17 minutes, the unit stopped cooking and went into ""warm"" mode, which was handy because I had other things to do first before dinner.  After pressure was released, I opened the top and was greeted by perfectly cooked vegies and ham.  Hubby was impressed.  I was impressed.', 'After dinner, clean up is relatively easy.

But the pot in this thing is made of non stick material, and if you look at other reviews you'll see that it is not non stick at all. Every time I cook with this pressure cooker, food gets stuck on the bottom. Even if it's a stew. Even if I put oil and water on the bottom of a roast. Everything sticks and I'm so tired of wasting time scraping the food off. Not to mention the amount of non stick coating my family has eaten because it chips off. It also retains a strange flavor.

Like the pressure cooker packaging and video (on YouTube) shows, it's not just a pressure cooker, it's a canning unit, a slow cooker, and a  crockpot. Be creative; cook what you want in it, you CAN NOT ruin a meal in this machine‼️‼️ You can pull all your leftovers from the refrigerator and make a 'mystery meal' it's AWESOME and FAST. It will do a pot roast in a 1/2 to 45 min, where in a traditional oven or on a BBQ, it may take 2 hours or so if you want it savory and moist. You get all that in 1/2 the time but tastes like it slow cooked all day, which by-the-way, you can let some meats and meals 'slow-cook' all day like a crockpot just to have it ready when you get home from a busy day. What we like is when you get ready to eat dinner just to realize you forgot to take something out of the freezer, no problem, we've taken from 'frozen-to-fabulous' in at least an hour also.

Things can burn in the bottom, and cleaning it removes some of the teflon coating.

I wish I could get my 88 dollars back.  I will try to contact Amazon, and try to get my money back.  The merchant who sold me this was Amazon itself, that is, sold and shipped by Amazon.

It was a re-package and they were welling it for $70 and then I got a $10 gift card for buying it, so all in all, it cost me $60. Anyhoo, I have to admit, they don\'t give you much training on how to 100% use this cooker. They include in theri very thin tiny booklet about how to use it some and after that, I just pretty much do a under guess. If I know in a slow cooker, something takes 6 hours, I cook it for about 20 minutes first and see if it is done, if not, I can usually tell how much longer I need to cook it and turn it back on. Gets back up to speed in less than 3 minutes. I love this thing. I made home made soup in it, chicken, etc. I just fell in love with it the first time I used it. I have very little time to do things with my son having therapy all the time and this thing is great. Its fast, the food tastes amazing, and I don\'t have to wait as long as a slow cooker but have the same great taste as one. And I love love how quiet it is, I had to put my ear to it to see if it was even working. Yes, it is a royal pain sometimes trying to figure out a recipe or two but its not Mt. Everest and can be done, if you have half a brain to figure it out. I mean, really. Its a pressure cooker for God\'s sake. You can find lots of pressure cooker recipes online; All recipes (dot) com is one of them and plenty on facebook/pintrest. I don\'t know why so many people are unhappy with it, I am quite surprised at this! I love it better than my old hissing, crappy, spitting hot steam out at you, pressure cooker. Sorry about you people who are unhappy, not everybody hates it and that doesn\'t make those of us who love it, evil or working for the manufacturer because we do. I think maybe it is because people think it is a ""set it, and forget it"" type of product; it is not. If that is what you are expecting, then don\'t buy this. But if you don\'t mind doing a little experimenting in order to get fast great meals, if you want something faster than a slow cooker, if you like that you can throw meat in frozen and still have it come out good and not having to defrost everything before you cook it, then you may like this appliance.']","['on November 27, 2014']",['\n      813 people found this helpful.\n    '],['5.0 out of 5 stars'],"['Despite the horrible reviews, I LOVE LOVE my Power Pressure Cooker XL!!']"

It comes with an instruction manual for the power pressure cooker XL and the power chopper XL. It also comes with a removable nonstick inner pot that is dishwasher safe and easy to clean. Along with 2 other accessories for steaming and cooking meats.  A removable AC cord, which I like because it looks nice and clean when I store it on my counter without a bulky cord in the way.', 'Once I opened the Power pressure cooker XL I did the initial cleaning as the instructions say and I started with a pork chop dish with one cup of water and one bottle of my favorite barbecue sauce. Cook the pork chops for 30 minutes using the baby back ribs pork entrées recipe from the power cooking cookbook which said to press the soup/stew button and the cook time selector button until the time is 30. It automatically shuts off and I used  a pair of tongs and opened the pressure valve.  I let the pressure cooker cool down, opened it up and my food was flawless and ready to serve. I have never tasted pork chops so good. They were falling apart and they tasted like ribs.', ""Usually I cook my pork chops in the oven and they turn out hard and make my teeth hurt but these were nothing like that.  Delicious!  I can't wait to make soups for the winter, rice and steamed vegetables.

I ate 2 pork chops for lunch when it was supposed to be my families dinner.  That should tell you how good the food was!  I could not wait!  Digital and easy to use!

I was impressed with the claims it made about being able to quick cook, slow cook, brown and steam rice so I bought it on a whim. I paid somewhat over a hundred dollars for it and took it home. I found the device was useless for slow cooking as it cooks far too hot and quickly and have had to purchase a new slow cooker as this product is so very inadequate for slow cooking, but the rice cooking setting, the searing and some of the pressure cooking recipes are excellent. Unfortunately we somehow lost the black pressure valve piece that allows the unit to pressurize and I went to their website to buy a replacement. This is where the company completely fails. Since I was buying parts I figured I would get some of the parts that have to be replaced on a regular basis. Having made my selections I went to the checkout screen and used my American Express card to check out. The screen asked for information I had already given multiple times and kept sending me back to the previous screen to refill information I had already input. I changed cards to a Visa card and thought I was successful on placing my order which I later found out was not the case. About an hour later I received a call from the company making an offer to me to purchase multiple Power Cookers at a deeply cut price but having thought that I had already ordered parts and not needing more units I turned them down. A little over a week went by and the parts I thought I had order didn’t show up. After checking I found that my credit card was never charged. I called the number listed on the website and found that you cannot speak directly to anyone, you have to leave a message. After days of waiting on a return call I went back to the website and tried to place an online order for parts again. This time my American Express was decline so I tried the Visa and a MasterCard which were likewise declined. I called again and also sent an email to the contact email address given. No return call came in and I never received an email reply from them. I don’t like having to write reviews like this so I have been more than patient with this company and although several months have passed since I first attempted to purchase parts, I tried again this morning. Well, as you can see, total failure. I have attempted to use every credit card I own, made calls and sent messages all to no avail. My recommendation is to stay as far from this product as you can. There are synthetic parts and seals in this product that have to be replaced to keep the unit operating and if you can’t get them the product is a big dust collector. The one I have now is going in the garbage and I will buy a different name brand after checking reviews.

1633,['lenajc'],"[""I got this as a Christmas gift. (Mom told me it was purchased with coupon at Bed Bath and Beyond for about $80 pre-tax). So far I've used this just twice: once for the sealing test indicated in the quick instructions and once to make beans. Some things I've noticed so far:"", ""1. There are actually three pressure settings: a low pressure general setting of 7.2 PSI (50 kPa) for most foods; a higher setting of 12 or 11.6 PSI (80 kPa) for canning/preservation; and an even lower pressure of <4.3 PSI (<30 kPa) for the slow cook setting (this information is in the manual). Note: the buttons don't indicate which is a higher or lower pressure setting. I had to get this information from a chart listed in the manual. I suppose if you know a little bit about canning, this may be apparent."", '2. Time to build up pressure: in the sealing test, the instructions indicate to fill up the pot about two-thirds full with water and to set it to the canning pressure (using the ""canning"" button). This took about 25 or 30 minutes to build up pressure. For the pound of dried beans I cooked with 8 cups of water, it took about 18 minutes to get it to pressure using the regular pressure setting (I used the ""Beans/Lentils"" button).', '3. Cooking time: the black beans cook time was longer than I had expected. I did not pre-soak the beans and at pressure it cooked for 30 minutes (total pot time was about 48 minutes which includes the time to get to pressure). The result is that the beans were cooked but a little bit firmer than I preferred. I was expecting it to come out creamier, but then I remembered that a low pressure setting was used (most articles I\'ve seen on this matter indicated a shorter cooking time but with a 15 PSI higher pressure setting). Next time I\'ll either cook for 5 minutes longer or use the higher pressure ""canning"" setting and cook for a slightly shorter duration. Side note: most instructions for pressure cooking beans will tell you to let the cooker de-pressurize naturally to reduce splitting. I didn\'t realize this and used the steam release valve and I didn\'t notice any bean splitting (this may because they were cooked at a lower pressure).', ""4. Steam leaks: didn't notice anything major. However, there is a small valve on the handle and I did notice while the beans were cooking that a slight (and I do mean slight) amount of steam was being released."", '5. Default cook time settings: for each food setting you can quickly alter the cook time setting to quick, medium, or well. I cooked my beans on the beans-well setting and it wasn\'t well done (see #3 above). Be prepared to alter the default settings using the ""time adjust"" button.', ""That's about all I have to write about at this point; I'll update more later.

I have used it now 3 times, and I honestly can say I like this cooker. I have never used a pressure cooker before, so was a little wary when it says you can cook something so quickly.  I had a little trouble with the stream release valve. If not seated perfectly, it will not come to pressure. I would not recommend leaving the cooker until it has pressurized, because in case you don't have it perfect it will not pressurize.  That being said, it doesn't take long before you can hear the steam releasing, and then just give it a slight turn and it sealed.  Additionally, I wish there were better instructions and more recipes.  I have cooked chili, pulled pork, and tonight we had yummy hamburger soup.  The soup and chili really did only take 10 min once the meat was browned, and was delish. The pork roast, the recipe said to use slow cooker setting, but I wanted to try cooking quickly, so I cooked on meat setting for 45 min and it was perfect.

1640,['Stacey P.'],"['I have had my PPC XL Pro 6qt (not purchased from Amazon) for almost a week now.  This was a gift. I was very excited to try it but also very confused by the lacking instructions and having never used one. The old stove top type scared me. Thus the research began.  My first attempt was a roasted potato recipe I found online.. Came out very flavorful! Although the next time I plan to pressure cook then use the saute otption to saute and make a little crisp, rather  than saute then pressure cook. Nextt up was boneless skinless chicken breasts with lime chili seasoning. My husband raived about how good that came out. I have also made marinara sauce and steamed broccoli another night. Tonght I made chicken and noodes. Perfect!! Sautedthe chicken with sliced onions in some olive oil (the chicken was frozen but sauted enuogh to still put a sear on the outside)  then added 2 cups broth and set for 8 minutes. Then released the pressure and added 8 ounces of egg noodles and enough broth to just cover them. Covered re-pressured and cooked for 5. I have not had any problems with food sticking to the bottom of the pot at all. Also it did not take anywhere near 17 minutes to pressurize. Maybe because I had already sauted? Or maybe it depends on how much you put in it?  In any case the wait time is not a problem. You have to wait for an oven to preheat and most heat producing kitchen appliances so to me it is like that. Granted a microwave is fast but the quality and flavor is not nearly the same. 4 stars for poor instructions.', '~Edit....  Some have said they were getting errors and could not lock or unlock the lid. Something to try.. After every use once cooled take a few water dampend q tips and run along the edge between the outer shell and the lip that the lid locks onto. Then using dry q tips dry the same area. It is very difficult to get a cloth in that little gap but q tips work great and ensure not little bit of food prevent a good seal.

1642,['Stephen Klima'],"['I purchased this after watching the infomercial. I know. Lame. But, I have used a slow cooker for years to make turkey chili. I thought this would be a good way to try it out. Before I did, though, I went through the ""seasoning"" process step by step as per the instructions. It hissed a little here and there, but according to the instructions it was now ready to go. Now for the real test, the chili. The next day I got all my ingredients together and browned the ground meat in the pot like I saw in the infomerical. This was awesome. Less clean up! After browning the meat, I added all the ingredients and set the timer for 30 minutes. I doubted that all the flavors would mix together the way they did after 8 hours in a crock pot, but they did. My family thought the chili was about the same, but I thought it was better. Better consistency, better taste, better all around. After we refrigerated the leftovers, I poured about two cups of water in the bottom of the cooking insert and let it sit overnight. The next morning I went to wash it, and there was a thick, black burnt mess at the bottom. This wasn\'t from the browning, but from when it was cooking. I tried a scrubber and it wouldn\'t come off at all. I finally had to get a brush and began brushing the bottom. This is where the design of the pot leaves much to be desired. At the bottom of the pot, there are small indentations that are shaped like pentagons. Hundreds of these. As I brushed the bottom, I really had to work to get all of the black gunk out of every single little crevice in these indentations. I finally got it clean after 15 minutes of scrubbing with a brush. After this experience, I read some Amazon reviews. Something I should have done first. In these reviews, I read that many pressure cookers come with stainless steel inner pots. Much, much easier to clean, I read. Needless to say, I dried off the pot, cleaned up everything, packed it up and returned the Power Pressure Cooker XL. I just bought an Instant Pot with a stainless steel insert. Haven\'t used it yet, but for the same price, it seems like a better built machine so far. Getting ready to make a pot roast in it tonight.

As most As Seen On TV products, the Power Pressure Cooker XL description is full of buzzwords.  ""Flavor infusion technology"" is my favorite, as it\'s just telling you that it does exactly what every other pressure cooker since the dawn of time does.  It\'s special computer onboard does do the heat management and run through preset routines, yes.  Is it actually ""smart"" and able to compensate for you minor screw ups?  Nope.  In fact, it takes a good deal of futzing and out-thinking the machine to get great results.  The bonus here is, if you take the time to learn it\'s nuances, you can do some serious cooking.  I\'ve rated how I have, in part, because of the way it\'s advertised.  So easy - just throw in the ingredients, hit the button, and wait.  Not true.  Following the included cookbook *exactly* yielded meals that were partially burnt, cooked correctly, and under cooked all at the same time.  I found a video on YouTube advertising this machine and going through one of the recipes in the guide.  Pot roast, to be exact.  Low and behold, if you watch closely, the man of the hour, Eric Theiss, doesn\'t follow the recipe in the book.  On a second go around, we followed his method and things came out great.  Chatting it up with another Top Reviewer who has experience with using pressure cookers, she wasn\'t surprised at all.  It\'s part art, knowing what makes sense vs what the cookbook tells you.  Now, if you do opt to try this out, the mac-n-cheese it makes is delicious!', ""The machine itself is pretty ok.  I'm not a fan of the button overlay style it uses, and there are two buttons which seem to have the exact same function but different name, (Time Adjustment and Cook Time Selector).  The guide book doesn't define the difference, and getting answers on this from any other source turned up nothing.  Interestingly, which button to use differed between the cookbook and the video previously mentioned.  The pressure valve setup is kinda funky, leaving me unsure it was actually seated and in the right spot pretty much every time I used it.  Apparently I had, as there were no explosions.  The non-stick inner pot is, well, not so non-stick.  Someone thought it would be a great idea to make a waffle pattern on the bottom, and when multiple meals got burned on the bottom, getting that crispy food off the pot took some soaking and elbow grease."", ""Overall, I don't think the Power Pressure Cooker XL is bad product, but I do think it's been over hyped as a simple and easy to use miracle machine for making meals."", '*Disclosure: I was contacted by a rep for Interact Marketing and provided a free sample for the purposes of giving my thoughts on it.*']","['on April 13, 2015']",['\n      5 people found this helpful.\n    '],['3.0 out of 5 stars'],['Lie to me!']

1664,['Paul S.'],"[""I purchased my Power Pressure Cooker XL last night and I have to say I am pretty impressed.  I was a bit skeptical after reading the negative reviews, but then realized that the ones pertaining to canning were irrelevant to me.  Also people were complaining about the lack of documentation, but since it's 2015 a quick reference guide is all that is included with most devices these days.  I got it home and followed the setup instructions of filling the inner pan 2/3 of the way up with water and turn on the canning mode for 10 minutes.  It does take awhile to heat up (15-20 min or so) and then runs the 10 minute cycle once pressure has been reached.  I am a pretty decent cook, so I decided not to try one of the included recipes.  I tried a family recipe for chicken mole`, which is basically a chicken and gravy dish.  I did not brown the chicken first as demonstrated in a few of the Youtube recipe videos, but may try this in the future.  I simply put the chicken quarters in the pot, added my seasonings and water and sealed the lid.  I used the chicken/meat setting for 40 minutes, but since the chicken was frozen I added an additional 5 minutes for good measure.  After about 10 minutes the cooker reached a pressurized state and began to cook.  The smell coming from that pot was awesome and my 5 year old even smelled it upstairs in her bedroom.  After it was done cooking, I turned it off from the Keep Warm setting and began to release the steam.  I must have filled the pot up too much with water because the broth was spewing from the valve along with the steam so I had to slowly release the steam until the pressure was low enough to turn the release all the way.  The chicken was completely cooked and falling off the bone just as advertised.  The flavor was a bit bland, but I attributed this to needing more seasoning than to any fault of the device itself.  When cooking over a stove, the broth has time to reduce as the water is cooked off resulting in a more intense flavor.  The next batch I made I used more seasoning and that seemed to do the trick.  I can't wait to try more entrees and perfect my recipes with this device.""]","['on February 25, 2015']",['\n      7 people found this helpful.\n    '],['5.0 out of 5 stars'],"['This thing is awesome, but pay attention to the details.']"

I\'ve had none of the problems others have mentioned, and the items I\'ve cooked have turned out great.  There is a clarifier with the previous statement, however.  The first items cooked turned out somewhat ""watery.""  I used a standard 8 oz. cup for the addition of liquid instead of the (approximate) 3 1/2 oz cup supplied with the unit.  If explicit use of the manufactures cup size is stated in the directions, then I missed it (I still haven\'t found such).  That could have been clearer.', 'Things have been fine, since.

This is done in the cooker.  By the time I complete those processes, the unit\'s usually ready for pressurization.  Place the lid on and its ready to do its thing.  A few of the recipes in the book use this method (the directions use the term ""brown the meat"").

Phase one cooking time was total duration required for the brisket, 70 minutes (about 20 minutes per pound for the 3.5 lb. brisket), minus 25 minutes; or 45 minutes.  As stated previously, I used the pressurization time during the first phase to prepare the meat for braising (about 25 minutes).

Do not use one cup of water from the cup that it supplied with your cooker, you'll need 4 cups of water if you use that one.  I have prepared Turkey wings in 45 minutes with mushroom gravy, I've prepared turkey necks frozen 3 packs with garlic, sausage, shrimp, potatoes and corn on the cob and crab/shrimp boil - It was delicious!  I cooked the turkey necks for 30 minutes, then I added the other items for 15 minutes and Wow - wonderful, and tasty!

My mom purchased this at Costco."", ""Intro - I have always been intrigued by the concept of pressure cookers. Especially when I wanted to cook something like dry beans. I mean, yeah. It's possible to do them without a pressure cooker but it's just a major pain and I don't have the patience or the will. The types of things I'm more likely to cook in this thing are stuff like sweet potatoes, chicken breast and roasts. These are all things that don't take forever when you do them other ways but they take long enough to stop you from doing it whenever you want."", "" I tend to use this pressure cooker to cook frozen chicken breasts. Because I buy a bunch and freeze them. They probably don't come out as well when you put them in while they're still frozen but I haven't tried that yet. It's just so convenient. They are much better than they are when I do them in the oven."", ' I have also made sweet potatoes in this and once I got the time right, they came out very good.', ' My main complains with this unit are....', ""1. The instructions are a little vague on some things. Like cleaning it. For example, the instruction booklet does not say whether or not it's possible to put the gasket on wrong. It just says to remove the gasket, clean it and put it back on. It looks the same (or close enough) that I can't tell if there's any difference which way you put it on. It would just be nice if they'd used their own product enough to realize a customer might have that problem. The instructions also do not say whether or not the gasket is dishwasher safe or what it is made of. I have decided to wash the gasket by hand because I don't want to take that chance."", ""2. The nonstick finish is really not something I'm all that fond of. I would prefer the insert be quality stainless."", ""3. This kind of relates to #1 but I kind or wish this thing was a little easier to clean. I don't know if the lid itself is dishwasher safe (and the manual doesn't say) so I do it by hand. Sometimes I feel like it takes longer to clean it than it does to cook with it."", '4. There are not really many recipes that come with it. And I really am not even that interested in complicated recipes. It would be nice if it came with a nice, clear chart that tells you how to make just about any of the most common things. For example, when I went to make sweet potatoes, I kind of just had to guess.', ""5. It costs quite a bit and I have a feeling it won't last all that long. I mean, everything seems to be of good quality but it lives or dies based on a gasket. When that gasket fails, you have to buy a new gasket or buy a new pressure cooker. I checked on their web site and the gasket is about ten dollars. That's more than ten percent of the total cost of what we paid for the unit new (about $80)."", "" Conclusion - I do like it. I think it will change the way I eat because I will be able to cook things that are time consuming way faster. The documentation that comes with the unit could be better. It wouldn't kill them to include an extra gasket just in case. I kinda wish the insert was stainless. Wish the whole lid was dishwasher safe. I hope it lasts long enough to justify the expense. If it lasts a few years I think it will be worth it. It's about the price of a cheap microwave, to put it in perspective. It does things a microwave really can't. You really can have a pretty good roast in less than an hour with this thing with almost no effort at all. You can put frozen meat in and get a pretty good meal in about a half an hour. I honestly can't wait to try some of the things I usually don't cook. Some people say you can buy cheaper cuts of beef and it still comes out pretty good with a pressure cooker. That sounds very appealing to me. I always shy away from things like roasts because of the high price of a good quality roast."", "" It really is a shame that this thing doesn't come with a full blown cookbook because the quality of the appliance itself seems very, very good for the price. You might not be able to find accurate instructions for a lot of the things you might want to make with it because there are different electric pressure cookers and they all work a little differently."", 'Will probably update this review as time goes on and I try more things.']","['on April 25, 2016']",[],['5.0 out of 5 stars'],"['So far, so good']"

I then read through the reviews here on Amazon and saw they were mixed, so I decided that we should buy it locally to expedite a return if need be.', 'I sent hubby to the nearest W-Mart to pick one up.  I also had him buy the ingredients for some homemade Mac ‘n Cheese to cook in the cooker when he got home as I always wanted to make that dish homemade. To say this was not a success is an understatement.  Hubby is already on the way back to the store to return the cooker. By the way, I am a seasoned cook – no problem with the convection oven, stove, microwave or Crockpot.  But this?  Not so much.', 'PROS - looks nice and substantial. Very big. If you have stainless steel appliances, this is nice enough to leave out on your counter.', 'CONS - Took way too long to pressurize, very poor instruction & recipe book, Solid locked top allows no way to check food during cooking without losing pressurization, therefore food may be under or overcooked.', 'WE RETURNED IT.  Read further to hear why...', 'Well, here goes...', 'The first surprise was reading the included “How to” sheet that said that the cooking time wouldn\'t begin until ""approximately 15-17 minutes after pushing the start button because the pot must become pressurized first.""  What?  The infomercial said, ""Drop in your food, add some liquid, press this button and 10 minutes later it\'s done!""  “Cook a pot full of chicken in just 25 minutes!” Hey! What about the pressurization wait time?  What about that?', 'Plus, the instructions are poor and do not include necessary information.  The instructions to set the cook time for something less or more than one of the programmed 10/20/30 minute buttons didn’t work. After multiple attempts at setting a time different than the above numbers and watching the screen zero out and not pressurize, we decided to just set it for one of the above times and manually stop the cooking at the time we needed by setting the stove timer. However, the stove timer couldn’t be started until the device reached pressurization.  So I had to stand there and watch the digital read out until it finally began counting down. So after the initial 40 minutes of fooling around with the controls and feeling the pot get hot but not pressurizing, then another 7 minutes of waiting again, it finally pressurized. I ran to start the stove timer.', 'The cooker was sitting on top of my kitchen island so I could watch it and the stove timer at the same time. Then, when the stove timer went off, I shut the cooker off and gently slid the steam release valve, to vent it so the top could be opened and the food removed from the heat.  Good Grief! I was shocked by the powerful jet of hot steam that blew nearly 2 feet in the air almost taking the island pendant light out!  The steam jet vented for a good 5-6 seconds. Good thing I have quick reflexes, otherwise the lightbulb would have burst!  There should be some sort of warning about the power and height of the steam jet and how one could cause damage or be burned badly by it.  Good thing I moved it from where it was on the counter under my new cabinets.

I washed all of the parts as directed but didn't notice that the two sides of the rubber gasket are slightly different and there is only one way to assemble it so that it seats properly.  As a result, it was difficult to close and lock the lid and it never pressurized after 30 minutes, although it did get hot.  So after waiting for it to cool, I took it all apart and started over and flipped the gasket over.  This time the lid closed more easily and it did pressurize after 20 minutes, which is more than the maximum of 17 minutes indicated in the manual.  Also, one of the first things I noticed is the pressure valve on top of the lid spins loosely with no way to keep it in the locked position, and it spins very easily to the open position.  Seems like it should be able to be held in either position and not just spin freely.

1775,['I Do The Speed Limit'],"['I love the fact that this cooker is automatic.  I do not have to pay constant attention to the steam releasing from the vent, lowering and raising the heat source under the pot to keep a constant temperature and pressure.  There is also no guesswork (from me) to decide when the pot has reached the correct pressure by watching for that plume of steam to start showing out of the vent.', 'I also love the slow-cook feature that cooks by low heat and holds in a low steam pressure.  And the browning feature?  It will get you sizzling in just moments.  It is amazingly quick to reach pressure, too.  (It takes longer when the pot is filled with liquid, but a whole 5.5 pound chicken, for example, takes just a few minutes.)', 'IMPORTANT:  The designers of this XL automatic pressure cooker have set the pressure for cooking ALL foods at 7.2psi.  (Many cookbook recipes call for 15 or 12psi.)  *There is NO pressure adjust button on this XL machine.  The pressure is set to 7.2psi for ALL programs EXCEPT canning (12psi) and slow cook (<4.3psi).  It should not be said that a cooker producing 15psi is ""better"" than one producing a lesser psi--it is just a different opinion of what temperature works best to cook food.  This machine will give you nice, juicy, quick results.', 'This program choices on this XL model are set for specific TIMES.  This model is meant for people who find it convenient to press a button and be done with it.  The different program settings have no other value:  There are no special ""sensors"" inside this machine that start heating cycles slower or faster.  The programs are based on time alone.  In other words, if you use the chicken/meat setting you have a pre-set choice of 15, 40 or 60 minutes and a 7.2psi.  If you use the soup/stew setting you have a pre-set choice of 10-30-60 minutes and a 7.2 psi.  If you adjust the chicken/meat setting to 30 minutes, it becomes the exact same setting as the soup/stew medium setting.', 'If you want control over your PRESSURE settings, this is probably not the model for you.', 'I personally like the results I get from the 7.2psi setting.  (That is the ""low"" setting on many manual cookers designed with a ""high"" and a ""low"" setting.)  If you are used to using a high pressure rating of 12-15psi, this 7.2psi setting may cause you grief, enough grief that you need to make a decision on whether you can deal with it before you further consider this automatic cooker.  The cooking TIME can be adjust in two different ways, but the TEMPERATURE/pressure rating (psi) cannot be changed.  (IMPORTANT INFO:  The 7.2psi cooks food at 228 degrees Fahrenheit.)', 'So, what are the other features of this cooker?  Let me give you some specifics on this Power Pressure Cooker XL that--in my mind--make it different from many others.  Of course, you have to weigh whether these features are a plus for you.', '--You can brown in this cooker--and brown very well and very quickly.  (Actually, I am amazed how well it browns, and how fast I get that job done.)  The browning feature on this model is a BIG plus.', '--The slow cooker program setting works at less than 4.3 psi.  Other pressure cookers have a ""high"" 12-15psi setting and a ""low"" 7.2 psi setting, but this pot also allows for a ""slow"" less than 4.3psi.  I like this setting, and have found it to work well for me.  My other slow cooker pots ooze copious amounts of steam and ""slow"" cooking is truly a slow process.  This pot holds a lot of the steam inside, speeding up the slow process.  This pot will use both slow, low heat and a steady low pressure to cook tough cuts of meat and other foods.  It produces a nice deep, rich flavor because flavor in the steam flows around inside the pot and has an opportunity to fall back into the brew before escaping out of the pot.  (Familiar with the very expensive 360 pots made in the USA?  I can get similar results with this cooker, and I don\'t have to keep watch like I do with the 360 pot and warmer base.)', '--You can use this machine as a rice cooker.  It does not have the choices that an expensive Zojirushi rice cooker has, but it does have settings for white and brown rice, and an even longer time setting for wild rice, although it is not really a rice.', '--Major plus:  It is easier to clean an insert in a pressure cooker, than to clean a heavy cooker (that sits on your cook top) with no insert.', ""--Major plus:  The automatic keep-warm mode is a nice feature.  If you get stuck in traffic, if you are left waiting in the parking lot for an after-school function that's running late, whatever.  At least you can rest easy knowing that your pressure cooker dinner is not going to be ruined.  It is best used with dishes that can afford to be over-cooked, (sauces, soups, stews, etc.) as it uses the natural, slow-release method of expelling steam."", '--The biggest failing of this machine is in the lack of instructions and too few recipe examples.  If you are inexperienced, or not willing or able to read between the lines, I would suggest this cooker is not for you.  I am experienced, and I am willing to interpret what is not spelled out.  But, I tell you, it took me hours to gain an understanding of this machine--and hours to write this review.  (Not necessarily a bad thing.....I surely do have a handle on the machine now.)  Then I still had unanswered questions.  I have to say that customer service was very helpful in answering my other questions.', '--Is there value to the delay setting?  If you are cooking something that can spoil sitting out in room temperature, then a delay setting of 0-24 hours is not helpful.  If you are cooking beans or rice, maybe it holds some value.', '--What is the value of the canning feature?  Safe pressure for canning is 11.6psi, and this model has a program for canning and preserving that keeps the psi at 12.  This cooker is not the same as a pressure canner, but it is safe for canning, comes with a wire canning rack and a cook-booklet of canning recipes.

I saw a review about the Power Pressure Cooker being available in stores and that if you had used a pressure cooker in the past that you would like the electric version. I went to Kohl\'s and was able to get a fabulous deal on one. I tried one of my old time favorite recipes from my mom\'s old 1946 Wear-Ever cookbook, Chicken and Dumplings. The results....Perfect! The cooker was easy to adapt to the old recipe. In the past, on the stove, I always had to make sure the heat was high enough to keep the pressure but low enough the food wouldn\'t scorched. I\'d have to stand and wait for the cooker to come up to pressure and then make sure I turned the burner down. With the electric version, I could set it and walk away even before it came up to pressure. I transferred the soup to a bowl and the Teflon coated inner bowl was scorch free. The next recipe I will try will be the 1946 Hungarian Goulash recipe which was my childhood favorite. For those feeling the cookbook in inadequate, do a search online for, ""how to use a pressure cooker"". It will help you understand more about how this appliance works.']","['on February 15, 2015']",['\n      7 people found this helpful.\n    '],['5.0 out of 5 stars'],['A Long Time Pressure Cooker User.']
